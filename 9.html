                        The Characters in <i>The Warmth of Other Suns</i> all left the South well before the banishment of Jim Crow there, but even still today there is inequality of the races. It takes many forms, but most can trace their way back to those same days that George Starling was packing in a night to ensure his safety.<br><br>
Housing inequality was one of the most blatant barriers for many blacks once leaving the South. To follow some of the trials that they faced, and how it has continued to shape where black Americans live, follow this link.<br><br>
Finding employment also became an issue for many blacks moving north. Black Americans moved north in anticipation of better jobs, but what met them wasnâ€™t all that much better. If they were able to find a job they likely got paid far less than any white workers doing the same work. To learn more about how employment inequality is affecting black Americans then and now, follow this link.<br><br>
A final element that cannot be ignored is that even today black Americans still face overt hatred. Racism is deep in the culture of America, and so hate crimes are still present to this day. To learn more about how overt racism is still present today.
